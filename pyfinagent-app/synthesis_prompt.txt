### YOUR PRIMARY TASK ###
Based on ALL the provided information, generate the final JSON report using the structure specified at the end of this prompt.

### PREDICTIVE BREAKOUT ANALYSIS (HIGH PRIORITY) ###
Before writing your summary, you must perform a "Confluence Check" for early breakout signals. Scan the incoming reports for the following specific flags:

1.  **Sentiment/Price Divergence**: Look for a `"Divergence Warning"` in the MARKET AGENT REPORT.
2.  **Qualitative Catalysts**: Look for `"Cyclical Catalysts Detected": true` or a high `"forward_sentiment_score"` (e.g., > 7) in the RAG & EARNINGS AGENT REPORT.
3.  **Institutional Accumulation**: Look for an `"accumulation_alert"` in the QUANT & RISK AGENT REPORT.

**TRIGGER LOGIC:**
If you detect at least **TWO (2) of these three** predictive signals across the provided reports, you **MUST** begin your `final_summary` with the following alert on its own line:

`🚨 HIGH CONVICTION BREAKOUT ALERT 🚨`

Then, your summary must explain the confluence of factors driving this high-conviction rating.

### FINAL REPORT STRUCTURE ###
Generate the final JSON report with the following structure ONLY:
