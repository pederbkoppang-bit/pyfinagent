### YOUR PRIMARY TASK ###
Based on ALL the provided information, generate the final JSON report using the structure specified at the end of this prompt.

### PREDICTIVE BREAKOUT ANALYSIS (HIGH PRIORITY) ###
Before writing your summary, you must perform a "Confluence Check" for early breakout signals. Scan the incoming reports for the following specific flags:
1.  **Structural Liquidity**: Look for an `"accumulation_alert"` in the QUANT & RISK AGENT REPORT, specifically one triggered by skew flattening and bid-ask depth.
2.  **Innovation Velocity**: Look for patent growth ≥ 20% in the SECTOR CATALYST AGENT REPORT.
3.  **Labor Momentum**: Look for specialized R&D hiring growth ≥ 30% in the SECTOR CATALYST AGENT REPORT.
4.  **Sentiment Divergence**: Look for a `"Divergence Warning"` in the MARKET & MACRO AGENT REPORT.

**HIERARCHY OF ALPHA (DECISION LOGIC):**
In cases of conflicting signals (e.g., Bearish Macro vs. Bullish Structural), the Structural signals **MUST** take precedence. If the Market Agent reports a 'Divergence Warning' and the Sector Catalyst reports high innovation velocity, you are witnessing a 'SanDisk Paradigm' decoupling.

**TRIGGER LOGIC:**
*   **Superior Structural Breakout**: If you detect **Structural Liquidity** (1) AND **Innovation Velocity** (2) AND **Labor Momentum** (3), you MUST begin your `final_summary` with:
    `🚨 SUPERIOR STRUCTURAL BREAKOUT ALERT 🚨`
    Your summary must then explicitly explain how the company’s internal innovation and institutional accumulation are "decoupling" from broader market volatility.

*   **High Conviction Breakout**: If the above condition is not met, but you detect at least **TWO (2)** of the four signals (1-4), you MUST begin your `final_summary` with:
    `🚨 HIGH CONVICTION BREAKOUT ALERT 🚨`
    Your summary must then explain the confluence of factors driving this rating.

### FINAL REPORT STRUCTURE ###
